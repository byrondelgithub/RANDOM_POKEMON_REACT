# Random Pokemon Generator website

[You can access our website here](https://random-poke-generator.com)

## Project Description

Random Pokemon Generator is a simple web app that shows a different pokemon everytime you enter in It. At first It started as a fast project for a friends because there are no good looking websites that does this with all the pokemon.

Then the project got more and more complex, to the point of adding sprites of 3 differents APIs, shinies, random pokemon moves, abilities and much more!
You can even search for specific pokemons using its ID or name.

This project isnt related at all with Pokemon company, Im just a junior programmer wanting to learn reactjs, chakra UI and GoogleAdSense.

## Credits

We use a lot of APIs to get the images and information of the pokemon, please check them out:

- [PkParaiso](https://pkparaiso.com): All of the animated sprites cames from here, but we only use the API to request the pokemon shield and sword HD gifs.
- [ProjectPokemon](https://projectpokemon.org): We use this API to retrieve all of the animated sprites from pokemon x y and pokemon sun moon. They say the gifs are from PkParaiso so why dont use only PkParaiso? Well, sometimes its servers totally flop and they bad pretty bad response times.
- [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co): We use this API for practically everything. We retrieve all of the pokemon info from here, we also request images when PkParaiso and ProjectPokemon fails. This API is so complete, I totally reccomend checking It out.

## Future

Im planning on creating a totally free API for all of the pokemon similar to PokeAPI but much simpler and with high definitions animated sprites for all of the pokemons using ruby on rails. What do you think about It? Please follow me in github to keep track of that project too.
